## Born from a love of the actually authentic

We believe that everything in life should be celebrated, and that each celebration should be uniquely you. Our style is bold, playful and a little bit o beat. Our couples are traditional but with a modern, personal  air.

Started in 2012 with a serious belief that nobody's personality is actually de ned by mason jars and burlap. Your wedding day is reflection of who you as a couple and a celebration of the special things you love about each other. (Fun fact: our own wedding, was cat themed. No, really.)

Dearly Design Co. is a stationery and design studio in Denver, Colorado and has been a part of over 1,000 events, worldwide.
