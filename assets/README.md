# Assets directory

This is a multi-use directory for both static and compiled assets that will be needed by the compiled site. This could include items such as:

* Font files that won't change.
* Image files that won't change.
* Image files that are generated via tools like ImageMagick.
* CSS files generated from Sass.
* Bundled JS files.
